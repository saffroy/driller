The Driller lib

Goal:
 * enable a group of processes to directly access memory of one another

Approach:
 * each process rebuilds its own address space with memory mapped files,
   and shares its file descriptors with others using unix sockets, so
   other processes can remap the memory regions in their own address space

Details:
 * rebuild
   a process can parse its /proc/self/maps to retrieve offsets and size
   of its data segments (ie. .data, stack, heap), then each segment
   can be copied to a temp (unlinked) file, which is then remapped over
   the original segment (which is thus discarded)
 * stack
   a temporary stack must be used while establishing the new stack, this
   can be done with swapcontext
   need to handle stack growth! cannot use mmap flags, so need to use
   segv handler (in alt stack, and up to stack limit)
   can handle limit (getrlimit)
 * data segments
   no global data should be used after the segments are copied and before
   the copies replace the original
 * heap
   no memory allocation while establishing the new heap, no access to
   alloc'ed memory either
   need to overload malloc! because libc malloc uses mmap _internally_
    (ie. overloading mmap does NOT work for libc malloc)
    simply using any external malloc that uses mmap should be enough
    candidates: hoard (big C++ thing), dlmalloc (simpler, public domain)
    to be able to perform allocations while in mmap/brk called by malloc,
     use a separate memory pool (dlmalloc makes this easy)
   better to overload brk:
    heap can no longer grow, malloc uses mmap
    thus overloading brk with calls to mmap/ftruncate saves the creation 
     of many small mmaps
   need to overload mmap:
    anonymous memory becomes shared temp file
    shared files remain shared
    private is copied (memory consuming, just like .data)
    ATM only anonymous maps handled; may well stay this way
   need to overload munmap:
    unmap, trim/delete affected maps, discard fd in proxy and in peers
   need to overload mremap:
    if identified map: remap, notify new map in peers?
    if does not fit a map, crash
   mprotect?
    XXX TBD
 * security
   credentials over unix sockets can be used (linux specific)
 * remote access
   pointer from one process becomes (pid, segment, offset) triple to
   identify the remapped segment in another process
 * lazy remapping
   a segment could be rebuilt only when a remote process needs access
   it could save memory, typically for data sections (and other private
   maps, which can be rare)
   but this costs a full segment copy for the first remote access of
   any segment, which is what we want to avoid
 * rodata
   non-writable segments need copying too (they can contain .rodata),
   unless the backing files can be found and mapped read-only
 * fully static linking? may work, but:
   - overloading will probably depend on link order
   - rtld_next can't be used! so overloaded syms should be called or rewritten
   - possible symbol collisions
 * threads
   concurrent access
   stacks: multiple stacks, maybe special mmap flags
   overload clone?
 * increased number of open fds
   there could be many, if needed they could be limited:
   - heap can be reimplemented by overloading brk/sbrk (done)
   - a single fd for a fixed size large chunk (eg. 1MB) is easily managed with
     a bitmap, and when necessary, unused space can be reclaimed by copying
     then remapping used areas at the end of the file; this means these areas
     must no longer be used by siblings...
     or maybe it's a silly idea: reclaiming scheme is intricate and costly,
     yet memory must be reclaimed (this is what app/libs manifest explicitely)
 * fork
   may work by overloading it:
   switch to temp stack, do fork, and child resets driller maps
   map cow? interesting but maybe not trivial

Pros
 * can use regular debuggers
 * produces regular core dumps
 * small code base, uses mostly well-known system interfaces
 * easily portable to other architectures
   (a bit more tricky for IA64 because of the two stacks)
 * cleanup of shared mem segments handled by the kernel

Cons
 * requires external allocator so mmap can be overloaded
 * dlmallopt is not glibc-compatible (though rather close)
 * creates fds unknown to the app, which can be troublesome (eg. when
   app expects its new fds to increase sequentially)
 * fork does not work (yet?)
 * increased memory consumption: segments are completely rewritten, no
   sharing of unmodified datas (how much? not sure if it's significant)
 * default tmpfs size is half of the memory, it may need to be increased
 * stack growth costs signal + 2 syscalls (mmap + getrlimit)
   mitigated by stack growth granularity
   could save call to getrlimit
   could save call to mmap by mapping a lot in advance and handling sigbus
   this would mean no signal, no control of getrlimit
 * not thread safe (yet)
 * not sure if it breaks some libs (qx, ib), may be worked around (blacklist)
 * some linuxisms limit OS portability:
   credentials over unix sockets (optional)
   abstract namespace for unix sockets (easier cleanup)
   parse /proc/self/maps
 * could use many file descriptors when malloc calls mmap, unless we
   use a single fd for most maps (ie. those starting at TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE)
   this will require an allocator
   see also notes above
 * brk costs 2 syscalls (ftruncate + mmap) vs. 1
   could save call to mmap by mapping a lot in advance
 * malloc of mmap'ed area costs 3 syscalls (open + ftruncate + mmap) vs. 1
   could be mitigated by fd cache
 * free of mmap'ed area costs 3 syscalls (munmap + ftruncate + close) vs. 1
   could be mitigated by fd cache
 * mremap of mmap'ed area costs 2 syscalls (ftruncate + mremap) vs. 1
 * must choose between profiling and rebuild of text+rodata segments
